Product introduction:
1. This module conform international safety standard, the isolation groove between control areas and load area
2. With optical coupling isolation, triggering more reliable, more stable
3. The double FR-4 circuit board design
4. Have power and relay operation instructions.The LED will be lit when relay on
5. Signal input with a low level signal, the common pin and the normally opened pin will connected
6. Relay can directly control all kinds of equipment and load
7. One normally open pin and a normally closed pin
8. Blue KF301 terminal, more convenient
9. Module Size: 53x18x18.5mm/2.08*0.7*0.72"
Module interface:
Input Part:
VCC: Connect to power positive (according to the relay voltage range)
GND: Connect to power negative
IN: Relay module trigger pin (high level trigger)
Output Part:
Normally Opened (NO) : Normally open pin of relay. NO pin is not connect to COM pin when relay off.NO pin is connect to COM pin when relay on
Common pin (COM) : Common pin of the relay
Normally closed (NC) : Normally close pin of relay.NC pin is connect to COM pin when relay off.NC pin is not connect to COM pin when relay on
Onboard 12V, 10A/250VAC, 10A 30VDC relay
