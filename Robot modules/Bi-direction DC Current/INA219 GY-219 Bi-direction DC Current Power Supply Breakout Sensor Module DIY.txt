Description:

This breakout board will solve all your power-monitoring problems.
 Instead of struggling with two multimeters, you can just use the 
handy INA219B chip on this breakout to both measure both the high 
side voltage and DC current draw over I2C with 1% precision.

Most current-measuring devices such as our current panel meter are 
only good for low side measuring. That means that unless you want 
to get a battery involved, you have to stick the measurement resistor 
between the target ground and true ground. This can cause problems 
with circuits since electronics tend to not like it when the ground 
references change and move with varying current draw. This chip is 
much smarter - it can handle high side current measuring, up to +26VDC, 
even though it is powered with 3 or 5V. It will also report back that 
high side voltage, which is great for tracking battery life or solar panels.

A precision amplifier measures the voltage across the 0.1 ohm, 1% sense 
resistor. Since the amplifier maximum input difference is ±320mV this 
means it can measure up to ±3.2 Amps. With the internal 12 bit ADC, 
the resolution at ±3.2A range is 0.8mA. With the internal gain set 
at the minimum of div8, the max current is ±400mA and the resolution 
is 0.1mA. Advanced hackers can remove the 0.1 ohm current sense resistor 
and replace it with their own to change the range (say a 0.01 ohm to 
measure up 32 Amps with a resolution of 8mA)

We include a 6-pin header (so you can easily attach this sensor to 
a breadboard) as well as a 3.5mm terminal plug so you can easily 
attach and detach your load. Usage is simple. Power the sensor 
itself with 3 to 5VDC and connect the two I2C pins up to your 
microcontroller. Then connect your target power supply to VIN+ and 
the load to ground to VIN-. We have an Arduino library right now 
that will do all the gain, range and math for you - just plug and 
go! We'll have a more detailed tutorial up shortly.
